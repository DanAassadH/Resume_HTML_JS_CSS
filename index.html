            </a>
            <p>This assignment was made using C#. The goal of this assignment was to allow the user to input data in a
                pre-defined array and then display it. As a part of challenge, the user could update or delete any item
                from the list and was allowed dynamic sized list.

            <p>This assignment was made using JavaScript. The goal of this assignment was to create the classical game
                of hangman. Its aim was to implement nested loops and use of DOM (Document object model). The challenge
                part was to implement two player game and make it presentable using CSS.</p>

                takes, down to the nearest quarter-hour.</p>
